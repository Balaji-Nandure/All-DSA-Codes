 * Problem: Missing ranges of numbers
 * 
 * GeeksforGeeks: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/missing-ranges-of-numbers/1
 * 
 * You have an inclusive interval [lower, upper] and a sorted array of unique integers arr[], 
 * all of which lie within this interval. A number x is considered missing if x is in the 
 * range [lower, upper] but not present in arr[]. Your task is to return the smallest set 
 * of sorted ranges that includes all missing numbers, ensuring no element from arr is 
 * within any range, and every missing number is covered exactly once.
 * 
 * Examples:
 * Input: arr[] = [14, 15, 20, 30, 31, 45], lower = 10, upper = 50
 * Output: [[10, 13], [16, 19], [21, 29], [32, 44], [46, 50]]
 * Explanation: These ranges represent all missing numbers between 10 and 50 not present in the array.
 * 
 * Input: arr[] = [-48, -10, -6, -4, 0, 4, 17], lower = -54, upper = 17
 * Output: [[-54, -49], [-47, -11], [-9, -7], [-5, -5], [-3, -1], [1, 3], [5,16]]
 * Explanation: These ranges cover all missing numbers between -54 and 17 not included in the array.
 * 
 * Input: arr[] = [15, 16, 17, 18], lower = 15, upper = 18
 * Output: []
 * Explanation: Since all numbers from 15 to 18 are present in the array, there are no missing intervals.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * -10^9 <= lower, upper <= 10^9
 * 1 <= arr.size() <= 10^5
 * lower <= arr[i] <= upper
 * 
 * Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
 * Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1) (excluding output)
 * 
 * Approach:
 * - Start from lower, iterate through the array
 * - For each gap between lower and arr[i], or between arr[i] and arr[i+1], add the range if start < end
 * - Handle the gap after the last element to upper
 * - Use long long to avoid overflow since lower and upper can be -1e9 to 1e9
 * - Add ranges as vectors [start, end]
 * 
 * Time: O(N) - single pass
 * Space: O(1) - constant, output not counted
